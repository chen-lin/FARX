Fractional-order AutoRegressive model with eXogenous variables for building thermodynamics

### How to use
Download and unzip farx and set _farx_ as the work folder in Matlab. Run farxid.m to identify a FARX model from the data in the _data_ folder and compare the performances of FARX and conventional ARX models. The data has been generated using a detailed model for building thermodynamics simulation.

Refer to reference [1] for the algorithm and the data description.
